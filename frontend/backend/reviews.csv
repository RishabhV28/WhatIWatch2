2022-07-10,Howl's Moving Castle,2004,https://boxd.it/30wrWJ,4,,"The overall feeling this film can create is unreal , it’s almost as if I’m craving for a place I’ve never been to . The way everything moves is fucking majestic and makes me reminisce of my childhood (which was nothing like this but still feels as beautiful as this film ).",,2022-07-10
2022-09-05,American Psycho,2000,https://boxd.it/3cmlCr,4,,……….and then Paul Allen said “oh no Patrick! Your are the American psycho!!”,,2022-09-05
2022-09-22,The Raid,2011,https://boxd.it/3foeUf,3.5,,Basically a very good video game film about a video game that doesn’t exist,,2022-09-21
2022-10-25,Black Adam,2022,https://boxd.it/3me2lP,2.5,,"The films is paced well enough to not feel slow and boring. The runtime could've been longer but I'm still fine with it. Black Adam doesn't seem as much of an anti hero as I expected, he's just a superhero who kills people sometime ( and they just happen to be bad I guess ). The rock is just playing a disappointed rock. There are 2 copyright songs that seem to be forced into the film. The villain only exists because we wanted a fight at the end. Appearance of hawk man and Dr fate was pretty cool. The action scenes are sincere but somewhat dumb. They tried to do a twist but didn't really worked out. There is a lot of actions which is a good thing. This film is better to watch with friends.",,2022-10-24
2022-10-25,Prey,2022,https://boxd.it/3mhSwB,3,,"The film is very well shot. The camera work really helps in making the film feel large scale.
The runtime is short which is a good thing. The main actress plays the role well enough so as to feel like a real character. The cg for invisible predator is done very well. Film only has one predator that is going around killing people which gives all characters a single enemy to defeat rather than an army which works well for this film because the weapons humans use are mostly primitive. The protagonist is a good female lead because the film wouldn't feel very different if the lead was a male which I think is the best way to put a female lead. Midway through the film the protagonist gets a random buff that makes her a good fighter which was weird. The film doesn't make the predator completely visible until half of the film is done which was a good decision. The predator actually feels like a monster with technology rather than just a buff dude with makeup. The final battle gives a plot Armor to the protagonist which I didn't really like. Overall I'd still say the film was a very entertaining watch with good production value and compelling plot. U should watch it.",,2022-10-25
2022-11-05,Cowboy Bebop,1998,https://boxd.it/3oL8eT,5,,This is perfection . Everything from the production to the plot to the aesthetic and the characters. Every episode has enough story to it to be its own film. Every character seems larger than life. The world building is done beautifully. This show is everything,,2022-11-05
2022-11-09,Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,2018,https://boxd.it/3pxXiD,5,,Beautiful fucking film. Vibes to the max. All the characters are treated exactly how they shouldve been. Nobody is too boring. The pacing is good. The film is eventful a the creative elements really add some life to the experience.,,2022-11-08
2022-11-09,Werewolf by Night,2022,https://boxd.it/3pxXst,4,,"While the film does feel like a Instagram filter in the beginning. But when u see the way werewolf fights (like a fucking Power Ranger or some shit), the way the transformation is depicted and the overall set vibe. U quickly realise that this was actually made with a retro theme in mind. The run time is short which was great for this film and the actors all put up a decent performance. The film still wasn't able to completely detach itself from the Marvel illness and I think that was the only limitation. Everything else was good enough. The plot was a little shallow tho. Good film",,2022-11-08
2022-11-09,The Matrix,1999,https://boxd.it/3pzgG7,5,,This is my first time watching it which means there is no nostalgic value for me in this film. This film holds up very well even compared to today's action films. The plot is very well written and feels very eventful without overwhelming the viewer. The actors put up a great performance and the set building does a good enough job of making an immersive experience. The villains feels threatening as he should and while the action feels a little jank it does the job. The pacing is fucking precise and everything works out. Great film,,2022-11-09
2022-11-10,Pulp Fiction,1994,https://boxd.it/3pHn8x,5,,Everything works pretty good imo. All the characters feel like they would be real people in some alternate dimension. Everyone is doing a great job at acting and the plot stays fresh through and through. The pacing is a little slower than I expected. But I still think it's a banger of a film. It feels like a very well done crossover episode of shows that don't exist.,,2022-11-09
2022-11-10,The Shining,1980,https://boxd.it/3pRvtj,4,,"This film is a slow burn. Feels a little too slow at times. Its shot magnificently, the feeling of liminality shines through the whole film. All actors do a good job, the first bar scene with Jack Nicholson was very good. The film leaves a lot on the audience to think about. The female lead did a great job as well. While the film was scary back when it came out. It doesn't have a very scary effect as of current times. Good film",,2022-11-10
2022-11-11,Taxi Driver,1976,https://boxd.it/3q38VD,4.5,,This film is peculiar. The pacing is just a tad bit slower than I expected. There is no main goal and I love that. The film is just a character arc of one man. Travis played by de niro. Looks pretty good cuz obviously it does. It. Represents the city as a dirty grim place and an overall grim look in the environment. Good film,,2022-11-11

2023-08-04,Taipei Story,1985,https://boxd.it/4DPaZt,5,,Probably the most beautiful film I've ever watched. Who would've thought it would be a Vietnamese film from 1985,,2023-08-04
2023-08-05,Drive,2011,https://boxd.it/4DRl0Z,3.5,Yes,"On a re-watch it really feels like this film lacks substance.
I mean yeah it's a short film but still the film is very dependent on its overall vibe and Ryan Gosling to carry its audience through the film.",,2023-08-04

2025-01-01,Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,1984,https://boxd.it/8g2p6F,4,,"In a demonic blood ritual a man ties another man to a contraption and  rips the heart out of him with his bare hands then lets the contraption down to a lava pit where the man is boiled alive.
Wtf will a white man with a whip supposed to do in that situation lmao",,2025-01-01
