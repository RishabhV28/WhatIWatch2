2021-06-24,Dunkirk,2017,https://boxd.it/1WIBGh,4,Yes,"The film is beautiful, that being said the plot and the whole film overall has a lot of moment where u will get bored , this movie is not about a protagonist,it’s about an exaggerated documentation of an event. However I would still consider to to be decently entertaining and insanely well shot , so it gets a pass👍",,2021-06-13
2021-06-24,The Terminal,2004,https://boxd.it/1WNd6f,4,Yes,"This movie has its own charm , the comedy is enjoyable and it could make for a very good Christmas film too, my biggest complain with this film is that we don’t ever feel sad for the protagonist which breaks the connection with the film as we are SUPPOSED to feel sad in the beginning. I would still consider this a great watch as it’s entertaining, it gets a pass 👍",,2021-06-24
